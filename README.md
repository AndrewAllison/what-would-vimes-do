# What Would Vimes Do?

A Discworld character advisor built with Mastra and OpenAI. This application allows you to ask questions and receive responses in the style of characters from Terry Pratchett's Discworld novels.

## üßô‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Overview

"What Would Vimes Do?" is an AI-powered application that simulates conversations with characters from the Discworld series. Currently, it supports:

- **Sam Vimes**: Commander of the Ankh-Morpork City Watch, known for his gruff demeanor and strong moral compass
- **Nanny Ogg**: A senior witch from Lancre, cheerful, mischievous, and always ready with folksy wisdom

The application uses OpenAI's GPT-4o model to generate responses that match each character's unique personality, speaking style, and background.

## ‚ú® Features

- Character selection based on name
- Natural language processing to understand user questions
- AI-generated responses that mimic the selected character's style
- Workflow-based architecture using Mastra framework
