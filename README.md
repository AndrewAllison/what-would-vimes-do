# What Would Vimes Do?

A Discworld character advisor built with Mastra and OpenAI. This application allows you to ask questions and receive responses in the style of characters from Terry Pratchett's Discworld novels.

## üßô‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Overview

"What Would Vimes Do?" is an AI-powered application that simulates conversations with characters from the Discworld series. Currently, it supports:

- **Sam Vimes**: Commander of the Ankh-Morpork City Watch, known for his gruff demeanor and strong moral compass
- **Nanny Ogg**: A senior witch from Lancre, cheerful, mischievous, and always ready with folksy wisdom

The application uses OpenAI's GPT-4o model to generate responses that match each character's unique personality, speaking style, and background.

## ‚ú® Features

- Character selection based on name
- Natural language processing to understand user questions
- AI-generated responses that mimic the selected character's style
- Workflow-based architecture using Mastra framework

## üöÄ Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd what-would-vimes-do
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pnpm install
   ```

3. Create a `.env.development` file with your OpenAI API key:
   ```
   OPENAI_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
   ```

## üöÄ Deployment Options

You can deploy this application using Docker for a containerized environment or Fly.io for a cloud deployment.

### üê≥ Deployment with Docker

#### Prerequisites

- Docker and Docker Compose installed on your system
- OpenAI API key

### Deployment Steps

#### Option 1: Using the deployment script

1. Make the script executable (if not already):
   ```bash
   chmod +x deploy.sh
   ```

2. Run the deployment script with your OpenAI API key:
   ```bash
   OPENAI_API_KEY=your_api_key_here ./deploy.sh
   ```

#### Option 2: Using npm/pnpm scripts

1. Deploy the application:
   ```bash
   OPENAI_API_KEY=your_api_key_here pnpm deploy
   ```

2. Or use individual Docker commands:
   ```bash
   # Build the Docker image
   pnpm docker:build

   # Start the container
   OPENAI_API_KEY=your_api_key_here pnpm docker:up

   # Stop the container
   pnpm docker:down
   ```

#### Option 3: Using Docker Compose directly

1. Build and start the Docker container:
   ```bash
   OPENAI_API_KEY=your_api_key_here docker-compose up -d
   ```

2. Access the application:
   - The application will be available at `http://localhost:4111`
   - The playground interface will be available at `http://localhost:4111/playground`

3. Stop the container:
   ```bash
   docker-compose down
   ```

### ‚úàÔ∏è Deployment with Fly.io

You can deploy this application to Fly.io for a cloud deployment with automatic scaling.

#### Prerequisites

- A Fly.io account
- Fly CLI installed (optional for manual deployment)
- OpenAI API key

#### Manual Deployment

1. Install the Fly CLI:
   ```bash
   curl -L https://fly.io/install.sh | sh
   ```

2. Login to Fly.io:
   ```bash
   fly auth login
   ```

3. Deploy the application:
   ```bash
   OPENAI_API_KEY=your_api_key_here fly deploy
   ```

#### Automated Deployment with GitHub Actions

This repository includes a GitHub Actions workflow that automatically deploys the application to Fly.io when changes are pushed to the main branch.

To set up automated deployment:

1. Generate a Fly.io API token:
   ```bash
   fly auth token
   ```

2. Add the token to your GitHub repository secrets:
   - Go to your GitHub repository
   - Click on "Settings" > "Secrets and variables" > "Actions"
   - Click "New repository secret"
   - Name: `FLY_API_TOKEN`
   - Value: Your Fly.io API token from step 1
   - Click "Add secret"

3. Add your OpenAI API key to GitHub repository secrets:
   - Follow the same steps as above
   - Name: `OPENAI_API_KEY`
   - Value: Your OpenAI API key
   - Click "Add secret"

4. Push changes to the main branch to trigger the deployment.

### Environment Variables

- `OPENAI_API_KEY`: Your OpenAI API key (required)
- `PORT`: The port on which the server will run (default: 4111)
- `NODE_ENV`: The environment mode (default: production for Docker deployment)
- `FLY_API_TOKEN`: Your Fly.io API token (required for GitHub Actions deployment)

A `.env.example` file is provided as a template. You can copy it to create your own environment files:

```bash
# For development
cp .env.example .env.development
# Edit .env.development with your actual values

# For production
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env with your actual values
```

### Persistent Data

The application stores data in a SQLite database file (`.mastra/mastra.db`). This file is mounted as a volume in the Docker container to ensure data persistence between container restarts.

## üîß Usage

1. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   pnpm dev
   ```

2. Use the application by providing a character name and a question:
   ```typescript
   // Example usage
   const response = await mastra.workflows.discworldAdvisorWorkflow.trigger({
     characterName: "Sam Vimes",
     userQuestion: "What do you think about politics?"
   });

   console.log(response.reply);
   ```
